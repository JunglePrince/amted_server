CSE 550 Project Preproposal

One thing we've noticed while implementing and debugging distributed systems is
that it's hard to piece together what's going on in the system just from console
logs. For our project, we would like to implement a visual logging tool for
distributed systems. We think the tool could be useful for debugging, or for
helping others understand how the system works.

At a high level, the tool would be a server that receives log messages from
the nodes in the system. From the logs, the tool could construct a graphical
view of the current state of the system. The types of logs the server could
receive might include:

  - Node registration
  - A node's internal state
  - Node sent a message
  - Node received a message
  - Message dropped

From these messages, the tool could show the nodes, their current state, and
messages in flight between nodes.

The tool itself would only require basic information about the system - mainly
the network configuration of each node. The nodes are responsible for converting
their internal state or messages to a human readable form to display in the tool.

We're planning to using the Paxos lock service from assignment 2 to test and
demo our project.
